Wonderword is an Angular project.  Steps to get it building and running -

1) Install NodeJS
2) From the command line, run "npm install" to pull down all the dependencies from Node Package Manager
3) To build and run, run "ng serve -o"

The project is configured to support Angular CLI (command line interface) - that's where the command in step 3 comes from.
